            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Object navigation is crucial for robots, but tra-
ditional methods require substantial training data and cannot
generalize to unknown environments. Zero-shot object naviga-
tion (ZSON) aims to address this challenge, enabling robots
to interact with unfamiliar objects without specific training
data. Language-driven zero-shot object navigation (L-ZSON)
is an extension of ZSON that incorporates natural language
instructions to guide robot navigation and interaction with
objects. In this paper, we propose VLTNet for L-ZSON, a
novel Vision Language model with a Tree-of-thought NETwork.
VLTNet comprises four main modules: vision language model
understanding, semantic mapping, tree-of-thought reasoning
and exploration, and goal identification. Among these mod-
ules, tree-of-thought (ToT) reasoning and exploration serve as
core components, innovatively using the ToT reasoning frame-
work for frontier selection in robot exploration. Compared
to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), ToT reason-
ing involves multi-path reasoning processes and backtracking
when necessary, enabling globally informed decision-making.
Experimental results on benchmarks such as PASTURE and
RoboTHOR demonstrate the outstanding performance of our
model in LZSON, particularly in scenarios involving complex
natural language as goal instructions.</p>
